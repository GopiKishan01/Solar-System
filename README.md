🌌 3D Solar System Simulation
An interactive 3D simulation of our solar system built with Three.js. This project visualizes the Sun and eight orbiting planets, complete with self-rotation, orbit rings, starfield background, tooltips, and interactive controls.

🚀 Features
☀️ Glowing Sun with realistic light emission

🪐 Eight planets with self-rotation and orbit movement

🌌 Dynamic starfield background

🧭 Orbit rings for each planet

🎛️ Adjustable orbit speed sliders

⏯️ Pause/Resume button

🖱️ Mouse drag to rotate the scene

🔍 Zoom with scroll

🪧 Planet name labels and tooltips on hover

🛠️ Built With
Three.js – 3D rendering library

HTML5 – structure

CSS3 – styling

JavaScript (ES6 Modules) – logic and interactivity
